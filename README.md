- Supplementary datasets created via web scraping:
  - Charge Hierarchy Description Dataset
  - Transportation Article Fine Dataset
  - SERO Codes Dataset

## üîç Analysis Highlights

- **Temporal Patterns**: Seasonal and time-of-day variations in traffic violations
- **Demographic Influences**: Court appearance rates and search patterns across demographic groups
- **Spatial Clustering**: Identification of high-risk violation zones
- **Predictive Insights**: Fine category prediction based on violation characteristics

## üöó Key Findings

- Winter showed highest traffic violations (27.01k)
- Most violations occurred in the morning on weekdays and at night on weekends
- Montgomery County center and border with Prince George's County had highest violation rates
- "Driver Failure to Obey Properly Placed Traffic Control Device Instructions" was the most common violation (39.4%)
- Black males had highest court appearance rate (11.4%) compared to 8% average
- Search conducted rates showed demographic disparities with 4.5% for Black individuals vs 3.2% overall average
